FostomEngine
============

Voxel based game engine written in D2 programming language. Voxel engines became actual when graphics card were able
to excecute generic code (CUDA and OpenCL). At this moment there are some experimental developments: Atomontage Engine,
Gigavoxels, Procedural Worlds. But all of them are closed or unrelased.

This engine based on Gigavoxel technology described in 
[this paper](http://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2011/Cra11/). The article can be seen as disign document and road map
for the project.
